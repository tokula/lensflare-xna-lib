## Description ##

The purpose is to create a library, that provides a framework and several utilities for creating simple/abstract 2D and 3D games more quickly and efficiently.
It will contain at least two example projects for 2D and 3D. Each with physics support.

## Framework ##

  * Entity-oriented logic and rendering
    * Clickable entities/shapes

## Independent Utilities ##

  * Camera
    * optional smooth movement/zoom
    * rendering only visible objects
  * Prefabs/Primitives
    * Shapes
      * 2D: Circle, Rectangle, ...
      * 3D: Sphere, Box, ...
    * Lines, Arrows, ...
  * Input (recognition for state changes and current state)

## Status ##

  * Library: 60%
  * 2D game example: 2%
  * 3D game example: 10% (frozen)
